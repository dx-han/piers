# Piers

Piers is an online, lightweight text processor that only supports local storage. It provides a comprehensive suite of text-related functionalities, including note-taking, coding, PDF management, and mind mapping. Designed to operate entirely within the browser, Piers allows users to access its resources initially online and then use all features completely offline, ensuring no data is sent back to the server. This approach guarantees swift processing and offers superior privacy for user data.
